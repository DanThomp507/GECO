## Project Overview

### Project name
> Orca Protocol
### Team members 
> Julia Rosenberg, John Sterlacci, Steven Valeri, Will Kim, Daniel Thompson, Gresshaa Mehta, Margaux Paradis. 
### What project are you building 
> Orca Protocol: a gas-efficient and Sybil-resistant DAO implementation using ERC1155.
### Why did you decide to build it 
> We believe that existing governance frameworks lack ways to meaningfully manage hierarchy and permissions resulting in voter apathy and misaligned voter incentives. Therefore, we are excited to build a flexible, adaptable, and user-friendly DAO implimentation with Orca Protocol. 
### How long will it take 
> Estimation of how long you will need to finalize the project
### How much funding are you requesting  
> How much money do will you need to finalize the project
### How did you hear about the GECO
> Through Graeme Barnes and Auryn Macmillan. 

## Your Proposal 
### Project description
Orca Protocol is a gas-efficient, Sybil-resistant DAO implementation using ERC1155. The protocol is equipped with a simple UI dashboard to manage DAO proposals and allow on-chain voting for on-chain assets, all secured using Gnosis Safe. Orca is made up of pods: organizations that consist of a fixed number of member tokens each representing a single vote. Each pod is linked to a Gnosis Safe vault to securely hold shared on-chain assets for on-chain voting.  

We have built pods modularly so they have the flexibility to accommodate infinite use cases including project governance, pooled investing, community management, and so much more. Our motivation in building Orca Protocol is to allow for DAOs to easily create customizable rules and manage permissions. We believe our adaptable protocol is a critical step toward on-chain governance reaching its full potential.
